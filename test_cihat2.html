<p>1 - We need to create an empty folder for git repo < p ></p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
git clone https: // github.com/CihatBaran/Article-App-Django.git
</pre>

<p>2 - If we want to change any files from inside we need to do below</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
vi .gitignore
#insert
i
#to be able to change anything scroll up and down change it 
#then write and quit with
:wq
</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    git status
    #it will give you untracked files
</pre>

<p>To remove file from folder</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    git rm -r <file-name>
    #or
    git rm -rf <file-name>
</pre>

<p>To be able to make sure that you don't have any file to delete
    There is a way for that
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint">
    git status |grep <file_name>
    #it will give you all files that you want or not
</pre>

<p>3- First Commit</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    git add . 
    git commit -m "First Commit"
</pre>

<strong>Commit is your local </strong>
<strong>But push is the remote not local anymore</strong>
<strong>if you push them all commits all the commits will be pushed</strong>
<strong>if you only add then it will be added to your stage</strong>
<strong>STAGE,REMOTE,LOCAL</strong>


<pre class="prettyprint">
    git push
</pre>

<p>
    4 - Add new commit and compare it with previous
</p>

<p>For example we have added below to test file</p>


<pre class="prettyprint">
    def test_sum():
        assert 3 == sum(1,2)
</pre>

<p>And then push it</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    git add test.py
    git status #to check
    git commit -m "dummy test"
    git push
</pre>

<p> 5- Conflict between commits</p>


<pre class="prettyprint">
    git add . 
    git commit -m "add"
    git push
    # if someone did the same changes with you you will get error
    # then pull it it will not change your working tree
    git pull origin master 
    # since we are working master
    # and you will see the places which have conflict
    # then arrange it and push it back
    git add .
    git commit -m "Solved Conflict"
    git push 
    # RESOLVED CONFLICT
</pre>

<p> 6 - Create new Branch</p>


<pre class="prettyprint">
    git branch -b "cihat_feature"
    # if you want to delete any branch
    # delete branch locally
    git branch -d localBranchName

    # delete branch remotely
    git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
    
    # and then
    git push --set-upstream origin cihat_feature
    # this will put our branch to remote
    # previously it was in local branch
    
</pre>

#================================

<p> 7- Merge the commits</p>
<p>
    Now we have two different branchs master, cihat_feature
    If we changed something on master and also changed on cihat_feature
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    git checkout <branch-name>
    git checkout master #now we are on master
    # and we have created index.html for example
    git checkout cihat_feature
    # then we are on cihat_feature branch
    # we have added about html and add,commit,push to branch
    # now we have different files for different branchs
    # master branch cannot be pushed because it is not going to be convenient
    # ! we need to go to GitHub 
    # ! pull request part we need to open a new pull request
    # ! base will be the master, compare will be the cihat_feature
    # ! Add the explanations
    # ! and create merge request
    # ! under the conversation Merge Pull Request
    # ! If there is no conflict
    # ! Now we have pushed the feature brands changes to the master
    # ! We can pull the last file through master
    git pull  
    # NOW everythins is up to date
    
</pre>

<p> 8- Rebase the commits</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    
    # assume that you have 4 different commits such below;
    # "added url","mistake","mistake-2","added modal"
    # in this example mistake, mistake-2 are not what we may want to commit
    # check your branch , you will see 4 commits on your log
    git log
    
    # to be able to make Merge Request 
    # you don't want to show mistake,mistake-2
    git rebase -i HEAD~3 #"mistake","mistake-2","added model"
    # now you will see the document you need to change something
    """
    pick 31adasf213 added modal
    pick 34davfd243 mistake-2
    pick 33davyd243 mistake
    change it to ðŸ‘‡
    """
    
    """
    pick 31adasf213 added modal
    s 34davfd243 mistake-2
    s 33davyd243 mistake
    #s means squash
    """
    
    git push --force-with-lease
    #this will push rebased commits because our commit id's has been changed
    
    # if we go to github we will see 

</pre>
